  title: 'Smooth Scaling, Happy Coding: Navigating Monorepo Adoption with Nx',
  description: `When your team grows, things get complicated fast. More apps mean more dependencies, code duplication, and headaches managing multiple repositories. At first, separate repos feel manageable, but soon you're stuck juggling inconsistent tooling, duplicated effort, and tricky dependency puzzles.

This talk walks through the real-world journey of adopting a monorepo strategy, sharing the tough spots you'll probably encounter along the way. I'll show how using Nx can ease the transition and make managing your monorepo a lot smoother as well as practical ways Nx helps keep your builds fast, your workflows clean, and your developers happy.

Whether you're already feeling the pain of scaling or just curious about monorepos, you'll leave with useful tips, real-life insights, and solid strategies for keeping growth smooth and your codebase healthy.`,
