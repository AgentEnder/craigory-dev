# Paradise Lost

## Quick Review

## The Longer Version

### Key Info:

- Location: East Village, NYC
- Date Visited: Dec 6, 2025
- Visited with: My Wife

### Our Visit

Paradise Lost was our last stop on a long night exploring NYC. It wasn't initially planned to be our last stop, though. We arrived at roughly 9:45, directly after leaving [Sunken Harbor Club](../sunken-harbor-club). We waited a good amount of time to put in our name, and were informed it would likely be quite a wait. There were roughly 25 parties ahead of us at the time, but we persisted and checked out a few more things around the area in the meantime. We recieved our text to return at 12:50 AM, and stayed till close at 2:00 AM.

Some of our feedback is definitely influenced by the late night visit, and I'm sure the staff and presentation would have been a bit better earlier in the night.

### The Drinks

Between my wife and I, we sampled:

- [REDACTED] ($23)
- Pearl Diver ($20)
- ***
- ***

You'll notice there's two blanks there. Unfortunately this visit was at the end of a long night, and while neither of us were overserved or otherwise too far gone, we unfortunately have forgotten what my wife ordered.

Nevertheless, the drinks we sampled were delightful. Nothing was too over the top garnishwise, but the flavors were there and met my admittedly pretty high expectations.

### The Food

Because of our late arrival, the kitchen had already been closed and we were not offered a food menu.

### Decor + Theming Elements

Paradise Lost is meant to be a "speaky-tiki", with the door being minimal and requiring ringing a doorbell to get in. From there, you walk down a short corridor before entering the main bar area, which is dimly lit and looks a bit like the inside of a ship or even perhaps a barrel.

The bathrooms were also decorated, with some cultist-prayers playing dimly over the speakers within.

All-in, the theming was OK. The drinks were well garnished, but there was not a ton of flair in the service and the overall look was a bit of a departure from what I was personally looking for. I do imagine that the service might have been a bit more ambitous earlier in the night, and would certainly be willing to give it another go.

## Tiki Rating Table

Placing Tiki bars in the table is a bit of a struggle for me, as I have two competing criteria in mind.

- The objective ratings of the drinks recieved, decor etc
- The subjective experience that we had that day, which often comes down to who was with me, the conversation we had etc.

We visited Paradise Lost at the end of a long day, and this meant there was no food and service was starting to wane. I'd love to give it another go earlier in the night, for a fair shot, but as we experienced it I would place it below Tiki Chick and well underneath Sunken Harbor Club.
