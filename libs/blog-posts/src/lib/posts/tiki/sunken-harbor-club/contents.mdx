# Sunken Harbor Club.

## Quick Review

Sunken Harbor Club, located in Brooklyn NY, was an absolute treat that's absolutely worth visiting. The food choices we sampled were both amazing, and neither my wife nor I experienced any disappointment with our selections.

## The Longer Version

### Key Info:

- Location: Brooklyn, New York
- Date Visited: Dec 6, 2025
- Visited with: My Wife

### Our Visit:

My wife and I take one overnight trip without the kids each year as an opportunity to reconnect and experience something new together. This year, we visited NYC and on Saturday night in particular had a pretty late night out. Sunken Harbor Club was intended to be our first stop of the night, but after receiving an estimated 2 hour wait, we visited a non-tiki prior. We walked to [Someday Bar](https://www.somedaybarnyc.com/) to kill some time, and left after a drink. We returned to Sunken Harbor Club, stopping by a few stores on the way to get closer to the estimated time.

The wait was pretty close to the estimate, and we were led up the staircase attached to Gage and Tollner to be seated in SHC. We were seated at the bar, where the head bartender Garret Richards was joined by two other bartenders who were all very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

### The Drinks

The drinks at Sunken Harbor Club were exceptional. Each cocktail was carefully crafted with attention to detail, and the flavors were well balanced. Our exact selections are below:

- Rum Barrel (me, $22)
- Rhyme of The Ancient Mariner (me, $18)
- Shattered Skull (shared, $45)
- Missionaries Downfall (my wife, $20)
- Incantation (my wife, $22)

Of the 5, all were excellent. I think the Incantation was our lowest rated drink, but I was pleasantly surprised with the communal bowl and the rum barrel. The prices were fairly in line with 2025 NYC pricing, so despite being rather expensive it was not a shock.

### The Food

My wife and I shared two menu items:

- Spam Banh Mi Sliders ($18)
- Miso Butterscotch Pudding ($12)

The sliders were served as a plate of 3, and the bartender that took our order offered to bump it to a plate of 4 to be able to split evenly. We opted not to, as we had came from dinner prior to arriving. The staff brought extra plates to facilitate sharing and the food was excellent.

The pudding was a decent portion, and the taste was out of this world. The miso flavoring and the toppings provided textural delight and a creative twist on a nostalgic childhood treat.

### Decor + Theming Elements

Sunken harbor club was well themed, albeit without some of the exciting effects that some tiki spots offer. The setting was definitely more classy, with a theme that made if feel like you were inside a sunken ship. At one point in our serving there was a fog machine that was turned on, with a small lazer show + bubbles. I don't believe this was tied to any of the drinks on the menu, but likely something they do sporadically over the service.

All in, I do wish there was a bit more interactivity with the theming and decor but the bar presents itself as a cohesive environment with plenty to look at and enjoy.

## Tiki Rating Table

Placing Tiki bars in the table is a bit of a struggle for me, as I have two competing criteria in mind.

- The objective ratings of the drinks recieved, decor etc
- The subjective experience that we had that day, which often comes down to who was with me, the conversation we had etc.

Sunken harbor club excelled in both regards. We found ourselves there mid-way through a day that is easily in the top 10 days of 2025 for me, and the experience at the bar only added to the enjoyment of the day.
