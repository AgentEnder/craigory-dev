# Tiki Chick.

## Quick Review

Located a quick walk from the subway, Tiki Chick was easy to get to and easy to enjoy. This was the second time I had gotten together with colleagues after joining Nx, and several of them accompanied me to check out this spot. The drinks were exactly as one would expect, and while not stand out they certainly didn't let down. Combined with $5 chicken sandwiches and creative seating arrangements, it made for a great experience that I'd happily revisit even if there are better themed bars in the area.

## The Longer Version

### Key Info:

- Location: NYC, NY
- Date Visited: Sep 29, 2023
- Visited with: 5-6 colleagues from work

### Our Visit:

Tiki Chick was an outing that I organized towards the end of a week-long onsite for Nx. This was the second onsite since I had joined the company, and was the second time I had seen most people in person. With everyone invited, a group of 6 - 7 of us boarded the subway near times square and made our way to the bar.

We waited approximately 15-20 minutes to be let in, and were initally guided to a standing area with a bar-height ledge attached to the wall. This was admittedly less than ideal, but after putting in our order for our first round we were led to a new area that featured a coffee table surrounded by a small couch, and a few other chairs. The seating was arranged such that we were all in a circle, and made conversation easy and enjoyable amongst the other noise.

### The Drinks

While I cannot speak for the drinks others received, I personally enjoyed tiki chick's:

- Mai Tai ($16)
- Zombie ($16)

In NYC a $16 cocktail is certainly not out of the ordinary, and not above other tiki bars prices that I've been to since. Both cocktails were fantastic and in line with their namesake, certainly a good sign.

### The food

Tiki Chick features $5 chicken sandwiches, which are not easy to find in NYC. After another colleague ordered one and enjoyed it, I also ordered one which featured hot honey. No complaints on my end, and the fried sandwiches were an excellent pairing to the heavy drinks.

### Decor + Theming Elements

Decor and overall theming were not Tiki Chick's strong point. If you are here for the escapism, this probably isn't it. We didn't sit in the outdoor section, but if you did I'd argue there was no theme whatsoever aside from a few boho chairs. Inside, the theme was a bit more pronounced but still overall very light. There were a few nautical elements, and drinks were served in mugs... but that was about it.

This isn't the bar for escapism, but is perhaps more approachable for a varied crowd looking for a casual night out.

## Tiki Rating Table

Placing Tiki bars in the table is a bit of a struggle for me, as I have two competing criteria in mind.

- The objective ratings of the drinks recieved, decor etc
- The subjective experience that we had that day, which often comes down to who was with me, the conversation we had etc.

The whole trip to NYC was a whirlwind of activity with colleagues, and the night out to tiki chick was a personal favorite. Depsite the light theming, it was hard to be dissapointed with good drinks and company.
