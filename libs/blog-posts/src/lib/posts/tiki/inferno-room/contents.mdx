# The Inferno Room.

## Quick Review

The Inferno Room is located near downtown Indianapolis, and offered great theming and drinks. Food pricing was a bit expensive, but portions made up for it so be prepared for the larger portions when ordering. While we visted at an awkward time, the experience was still enjoyed and I'd hope to come back in the future.

## The Longer Version

### Key Info:

- Location: Indianapolis, IN
- Date Visited: Aug 1, 2025
- Visited with: My Wife

### Our Visit:

We visited the Inferno Room early in the day on Thursday, August 1st, 2025. We had a concert to attend that started at 6:30, roughly 40 minutes away so with the inferno room opening at 4:00 our plan was to get there right when it opened... But, not everything ends up going according to plan and we arrived closer to 5:15 after some misnavigation to the hotel prior.

As such we were a bit rushed, but the bar was still almost empty being early on a Thursday so wait times inside were minimal. Once inside, we were sat at the bar and offered menus to look over.

### The Drinks

My wife and I each purchased a few drinks, sharing a few sips along the way. All together, we tried their renditions of:

- Heart of the Sun x 2 - My wife loved mine, and ended up with her own.
- Mango Diablo
- Titilating Tart
- Tambaran Firedancer

Drinks were priced at $15 each, which is reasonable and about what I'd expect for a tiki bar or specialty cocktail bar. The drinks were overall very good, although the mango diablo was not enjoyable for my wife. It featured mezcal heavily, and was super smoky, which she was not expecting nor familiar with. We concluded that if someone was to like mezcal, they'd likely be fine with the drink, but for her it was a no-go.

### The food

The Inferno Room has an extensive food menu, and our plan was to eat here prior to our concert. In the end, we purchased two dishes:

- Disco Fries ($13)
- Pineapple Fried Rice ($18)

We felt that the pricing was a bit high when looking at the website before coming, but in the end the portions were way larger than we expected and I'd consider it reasonable. Both items were really good, but they did take a bit of time to come to the table so I'd recommend ordering them as soon as you get a chance rather than waiting to finish your first round.

### Decor + Theming Elements

Walking into the Inferno Room was a wild experience. Outside the building there was very little to indicate what waited inside, and it honestly felt like it was in the middle of nowhere for being downtown. Stepping inside, the theming was everywhere and immediate. Bamboo, lighting, totem poles, and a whole lot more contributed to creating the full experience.

As for effects / interactive drinks, the Tambaran Firedancer was presented with a flaming lime half and a shaker of cinnamon and coffee creamer was used tableside to create a small fireball. I did not notice other drinks with effects, but its possible there were more.

## Tiki Rating Table

Placing Tiki bars in the table is a bit of a struggle for me, as I have two competing criteria in mind.

- The objective ratings of the drinks recieved, decor etc
- The subjective experience that we had that day, which often comes down to who was with me, the conversation we had etc.

This trip was overall part of a very fun time, but the visit to the Inferno Room was hampered a bit by our time constraints and the rushed nature of our visit. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere, and I'd love to come back and experience it more fully in the future.
