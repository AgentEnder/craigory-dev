  title: "Benchmarking like a Scientist: Communicating Code's Performance.",
  description: `This session will explore several aspects of benchmarking. We will start by introducing the concept of code benchmarking, what it is and why it is important in software development. We will then cover the different approaches to benchmarking, including micro, macro, and synthetic benchmarking, and examine the pros and cons of each method.
Next, we will delve into the best practices of benchmarking and the common pitfalls to avoid. This will include topics such as selecting the right metrics, avoiding bias in your benchmark results, and controlling environmental factors to ensure repeatability and reproducibility. We will also discuss the importance of benchmarking throughout the development process, and how it can be used to inform design decisions and optimize code.        In addition to the technical aspects of benchmarking, we will also be focusing on the crucial aspect of communication. We will cover how to present your benchmark results in a clear and concise manner, so that they can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This includes best practices for visualizing your results, and tips for effectively communicating the performance of your code.
This session is aimed at developers of all levels, from those new to the field to experienced professionals. Whether you are looking to improve your benchmarking skills, or simply want to gain a deeper understanding of the science behind code performance, this session will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.`,

  title: "Full Stack Type Safety Across Languages",
  description: `One of the benefits many companies see in monorepos is that you can share interfaces across your front-end and back-end code. Sharing interfaces enables you to create bulletproof API layers on the web but requires that your back end is also in JS.
  This chat will introduce Nx to facilitate the conversation and use .NET and Angular as the driving example. Knowledge of the three technologies is optional, though; the tools will only be introduced enough to understand what is needed. All knowledge introduced should be transferrable to other tools.
We can take advantage of build pipelines and dependencies to ensure that accurate typings are generated for our front end before the typescript build, and introducing caching prevents any of the slowdowns that folks may be accustomed to with some older monorepo solutions.
The second half of the session will guide attendees in setting this up on their local machine, so that they can more thoroughly interact with it.`,

The driving example will utilize C# and ASP.NET Core, with Angular for the front end. Alternative commands will be provided for react, but both the front end and back end can be swapped out for nearly any tool that you may want to use`,

  description: `When your team grows, things get complicated fast. More apps mean more dependencies, code duplication, and headaches managing multiple repositories. At first, separate repos feel manageable, but soon you're stuck juggling inconsistent tooling, duplicated effort, and tricky dependency puzzles.

This talk walks through the real-world journey of adopting a monorepo strategy, sharing the tough spots you'll probably encounter along the way. I'll show how using Nx can ease the transition and make managing your monorepo a lot smoother as well as practical ways Nx helps keep your builds fast, your workflows clean, and your developers happy.

Whether you're already feeling the pain of scaling or just curious about monorepos, you'll leave with useful tips, real-life insights, and solid strategies for keeping growth smooth and your codebase healthy.`,
